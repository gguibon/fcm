France 's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council phase out the oil - for - food program , which allowed Iraq to sell unlimited quantities of oil provided the money went for humanitarian goods and compensation to victims of the first Gulf War .


France 's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council `` find practical and pragmatic arrangements '' to coordinate and combine the work of the American teams and the work of UN inspectors `` so that the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified . ''


France 's UN ambassador , Jean - Marc de La Sabliere , made the proposal at a Security Council meeting where members heard a briefing by chief UN weapons inspector Hans Blix and for the first time exchanged views on potentially divisive postwar issues .


Under council resolutions , sanctions can not be lifted until UN inspectors certify that Iraq 's nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been destroyed along with the long - range missiles to deliver them .

At another closed - door council meeting later Tuesday , the council was to hear from Benon Sevan , head of the UN oil - for - food program , which had been providing food for 60 percent of Iraq 's 24 million people .


The surprise move by France , which led opposition to the US war against Iraq , followed last week 's call by US President George W Bush for sanctions to be lifted quickly , so Iraq can trade freely and its oil revenue can be used to finance reconstruction .

Under council resolutions , sanctions can not be lifted until UN inspectors certify that Iraq 's nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been destroyed along with the long - range missiles to deliver them .


But he said Russia wants UN inspectors to certify that Iraq has been disarmed of all weapons of mass destruction , as required under UN resolutions .


Blix stressed that council resolutions call for UN inspectors to have access to all sites and people in Iraq .


`` At the moment , the coalition has assumed the responsibilities for disarming Iraq , '' US Ambassador John Negroponte , said Tuesday when asked whether US teams would work with UN inspectors .


France 's de La Sabliere said he also proposed that the council `` find practical and pragmatic arrangements '' to coordinate and combine the work of the American teams and the work of UN inspectors `` so that the Iraqi disarmament could be internationally verified . ''


UN inspectors went back to Iraq for the first time in four years in late November and discovered no weapons of mass destruction during 3 { months of searching .


He also envisioned US and UN inspectors working together .

But US Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz said Monday that the threat could n't be ignored .


`` Certainly what we know suggests that we should take what they ( North Korean officials ) are saying very seriously , '' he said at a news conference in Seoul .


Roh spoke after meeting the US lawmakers and Wolfowitz , who also arrived in Seoul on Sunday for a two - day visit to discuss North Korea .


Wolfowitz said Saturday in Singapore that Washington hoped putting pressure on North Korea 's battered economy would resolve the nuclear standoff .


In meetings with South Korean officials , Wolfowitz urged them to increase military spending on new technologies and telecommunications equipment , as US forces have done .


South Korea earmarks about US $ 145 billion for its military .


`` They still work with paper and pencil instead of with the kind of modern communications gear that our special forces took with them to Afghanistan , '' Wolfowitz said .


The nuclear crisis flared last October when US officials said North Korea admitted running a secret nuclear weapons program in violation of a 1994 accord with Washington .

i 'll try to explain it the best i can from what i remember from being on the " uss abraham lincoln " this is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what the navy does with regard to prevention .


also drills take place before sailors get on to any ship , before any deployment , usually twice a day , they 're practicing man overboard drills , knowing where to go , where to report to if indeed a man overboard takes place and as the deployment begins , those wane off , but they know where to go quickly .


inside those helicopters rescue imswimmers .


everybody that is , every sailor that 's entersing the navy does take a swim test .


if the man overboard is injured then they may use a basket , but more than likely those swimmers will go right into the water and try and help the swimmer hook up on that harness and pull them up into the helo and pull them back on to the ship for treatment and usually a search takes about 24 hours .

In the assessment , which they have shared with Japan , South Korea and other allies in recent weeks , officials at the Central Intelligence Agency said that US satellites have identified a sophisticated new nuclear testing site in an area called Youngdoktong .


US satellites have been watching North Korean nuclear activity intently since late last year , when the North evicted international inspectors .

North Korea , unlike Iraq , has made no secret of its plan to develop nuclear weapons .


The new intelligence estimates provided to Asian allies , however , left it unclear how quickly the North could produce the small warheads .

Blair and Bush were expected to bridge their gap on the issue by reaching an agreement on UN role in post - war Iraq , some analysts said even before this summit at Hillsborough , south of Belfast , the second of its kind since the war broke out on March 20 .


In a joint written statement , the two allies pledged to seek UN Security Council resolutions to affirm Iraq 's territorial integrity , ensure aid delivery and endorse an " appropriate " post - conflict administration for Iraq .

Amid the financial storms last year and the ensuing cracking down on corporate malfeasance , Waksal pleaded guilty in October to charges involving his efforts to sell a huge block of his company ' s stock in late 2001 .


This incident then triggered legal investigations , which also included the case of a US media and domestic design diva , Martha Stewart .
